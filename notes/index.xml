The image gets uploaded to Amazon S3 by my Singulus backend, which in turn publishes it to this Hugo website by adding the URL and alt text of the photo to the YAML front matter in the post.
Although the Singulus backend supports multiple asset uploads to a single post right now, the theme for this Hugo site currently renders just the first photo as the hero image for the post.</description></item><item><title/><link>/notes/de6a9e/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:08:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/de6a9e/</guid><description>This is my first note created in Singulus and automatically published to Hugo!</description></item><item><title/><link>/notes/6adc51/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:21:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/6adc51/</guid><description>This is a note on tonyburns.net.
